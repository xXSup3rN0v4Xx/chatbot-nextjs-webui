# Performance Optimization for 144Hz Displays

## Overview
Optimized the drag and resize operations to run smoothly at 144Hz refresh rates with minimal lag and jank.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Optimizations (`globals.css`)

#### Removed Transitions During Drag/Resize
- **Before**: `.react-grid-item` had `transition: all 0.2s ease` which caused lag
- **After**: `transition: none !important` during drag/resize for instant feedback

#### GPU Acceleration
Added hardware acceleration properties:
```css
.react-grid-item {
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  will-change: transform, width, height;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
  perspective: 1000px;
  contain: layout style paint;
}
```

#### Optimized Placeholder
- Changed placeholder transition to `none` for instant visual feedback
- Reduced opacity from 0.6 to 0.8 for better visibility
- Added `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU acceleration

#### Enhanced Resize Handle
- Increased size from 20px to 24px for easier grabbing
- Improved hover opacity from 0.4 to 1.0
- Added GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`

### 2. Component Optimizations

#### Grid Layout Configuration (`page.jsx`)
Added performance-focused properties:
```jsx
<ResponsiveGridLayout
  autoSize={true}
  verticalCompact={true}
  // ... other props
>
```

#### Layout Change Handler Optimization
```jsx
const handleLayoutChange = useCallback((newLayout) => {
  // Only update if not currently dragging to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  if (!isDragging) {
    setLayout(newLayout)
  }
}, [isDragging])
```

This prevents state updates during drag operations, which would trigger re-renders and cause lag.

#### GPU Acceleration on Cards
All card components now use:
```jsx
style={{ transform: 'translateZ(0)', willChange: 'contents' }}
```

This forces GPU acceleration and hints to the browser what will change.

### 3. CSS Containment (`custom-grid.css`)

Added CSS containment to prevent unnecessary repaints:
```css
.react-grid-item {
  contain: layout style paint;
}

.react-grid-item > div {
  contain: layout style paint;
}
```

This tells the browser that the element's layout, style, and paint are isolated from the rest of the page.

### 4. Optimized State Management

Removed console.log statements from drag handlers to reduce JavaScript execution time during drag operations.

## Performance Benefits

### Before:
- Transition delays caused visible lag
- State updates during drag caused re-renders
- No GPU acceleration
- Frequent repaints of entire layout

### After:
- ✅ **Zero transition delay** during drag/resize
- ✅ **GPU-accelerated transforms** for smooth 144Hz rendering
- ✅ **No re-renders during drag** operations
- ✅ **Isolated paint operations** prevent cascade repaints
- ✅ **Instant visual feedback** with optimized placeholder
- ✅ **Reduced CPU usage** during drag operations

## Testing on 144Hz Display

To verify the optimization:

1. Open browser DevTools > Performance
2. Start recording
3. Drag/resize cards rapidly
4. Check the frame rate - should maintain 144 FPS
5. Check for:
   - No layout thrashing
   - Minimal paint operations
   - Smooth transform updates
   - No dropped frames

## Browser Optimization Features Used

1. **CSS Transforms** - Hardware accelerated 2D/3D transforms
2. **will-change** - Hints to browser about upcoming changes
3. **contain** - Limits layout/paint recalculation scope
4. **translate3d** - Forces GPU layer promotion
5. **backface-visibility: hidden** - Reduces overdraw

## Additional Notes

- The `transformScale={1}` ensures no unnecessary scaling calculations
- `useCSSTransforms={true}` uses CSS transforms instead of top/left positioning
- `preventCollision={false}` allows overlapping during drag for smoother experience
- Vertical compaction happens only when drag stops, not during drag

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- RequestAnimationFrame throttling for resize events
- Virtual scrolling for chat history with many messages
- Memoization of complex calculations
- Web Workers for heavy computations during resize
